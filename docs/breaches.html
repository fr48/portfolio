Large retailers, government agencies, universities, and banks: no one seems to be immune. </p>
</div> <div class="story-body"> <h3>Breaches Rising</h3> <p>Each year, there are more data breaches. 2018 was a particularly bad year, but the first half of 2019 already has more breaches than the first half of 2018, and the pace of breaches hasn't slowed down. </p> <div id="chart-1"></div>  <p class="chart-source">Source: Identity Theft Resource Center</p>
</div> <script src="breach-total-chart.73af3bd8.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p> Any company or organization can get breached, because every organization has information that is valuable to someone. While breaches at businesses, such as retailers, hotels, and restaurants have dominated the new over the past five years, there have been a number of bad healthcare-related breaches in recent years. </p>
</div> <div class="story-body"> <h3> Who is Losing the Data?</h3> <p>While anyone can be breached, businesses and healthcare organizations are the most affected. While government, education, and financial services have data breaches, they are fewer in number.</p> <div id="chart-2"></div>  <p class="chart-source">Source: Identity Theft Resource Center</p>
</div>  <div class="story-body"> <h2>What Has Been Stolen</h2> <p>Different states have different rules about breach notifications. Massachusettes is among the few states that require organizations to be explicit about what types of information have been compromised. Social Security numbers are by far the most common pieces of data exposed in 2018 and 2019. More SSN were stolen in the first half of 2019 than the first half of 2018.</p> <p>Account numbers -- not just bank accounts, but rewards programs, frequent flier miles, and billing information at other ecommerce sites -- are also higly sought for. There were more breaches that exposed payment cards -- credit and debit cards -- than in previous years. Interestingly, more drivers license numbers were stolen in the first half of 2019 than all of 2018. </p>
</div> <div class="story-body"> <h3>Stolen Records</h3> <p>Account numbers and Social Security numbers are the most commonly targeted pieces of information, even at healthcare organizations. </p> <div id="chart-3"></div>  <p class="chart-source">Sources: Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, Commonwealth of Massachusetts</p> </div>  <div class="story-body"> <h2>Breach Fatigue Sets In</h2> <p>Every week, there is a new report about a data breach. Sometimes, it's cybercriminals breaking into organizations to steal data and other times it's nation-state spies intent on collecting information for their espionage games. Many times, it's a simple matter of the company losing the data (say, a laptop holding a spreadsheet) rather than someone nefarious thief. There are also times when the organization forgot to protect the information and left it on the Internet for any curious person to find. Then there are times when we simply don't know what happened. But whatever the reason, most American adults have been affected at least once by a data breach over the past few years. And for many, they have become resigned and no longer may be as concerned with a breach. </p> </div> <div class="footer"> &copy; <a href=""></a> 2019 </div> </main>  <script src="ai2html-resizer.648d3b51.js"></script> </body></html>
